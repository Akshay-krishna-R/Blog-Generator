## Understanding `requirements.txt`

### Purpose
The `requirements.txt` file is a commonly used convention in Python projects to specify the dependencies required by the project to run successfully.

### Usage
Developers create a `requirements.txt` file to document and manage the project's dependencies. It lists the Python packages along with their versions that are necessary for the project to function as intended.

### Format
The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of Python packages, each specified on a separate line. Version specifiers can be included to ensure compatibility with specific package versions.

Example:
```
sentence-transformers
uvicorn
ctransformers
langchain
python-box
streamlit
```

### Installation
To install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`, use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Conclusion
The `requirements.txt` file is vital for managing dependencies and ensuring consistent environments across different setups and deployment environments.
